abstract = {In recent years, vehicular networks have seen a proliferation of applications and services such as image tagging, lane detection, and speech recognition. Many of these applications rely on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and demand low-latency computation. To meet these requirements, Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC) has been introduced to augment the abundant computation capacity of vehicular networks to complement limited computation resources on vehicles. Nevertheless, offloading DNN tasks to MEC (Multi-access Edge Computing) servers effectively and efficiently remains a challenging topic due to the dynamic nature of vehicular mobility and varying loads on the servers. In this paper, we propose a novel and efficient distributed DNN Partitioning And Offloading (DPAO), leveraging the mobility of vehicles and the synergy between vehicle–edge and edge–edge computing. We exploit the variations in both computation time and output data size across different layers of DNN to make optimized decisions for accelerating DNN computations while reducing the transmission time of intermediate data. In the meantime, we dynamically partition and offload tasks between MEC servers based on their load differences. We have conducted extensive simulations and testbed experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of DPAO. The evaluation results show that, compared to offloaded all tasks to MEC server, DPAO reduces the latency of DNN tasks by 2.4x. DPAO with queue reservation can further reduce the task average completion time by 10%.}

  abstract     = {Proliferation of the number of smart devices and user applications has generated a tremendous volume of data traffic
                  from/to a cellular network. With a traditional cellular network, a user may experience many drawbacks such as low throughput, large latencies and network outages due to overload of data traffic. The software defined network (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV) rise as a promising solution to overcome such issues of traditional network architecture. In this paper, we introduce a new network architecture for LTE and WiFi slicing networks taking into account the advantage of SDN and NFV concepts. We propose an IPFlow management controller in a slicing network to offload and balance the flow data traffic. By utilizing the P-GW and Wireless Access Gateway, we can handle the IP-Flow between LTE and WiFi networks. The P-GW works as an IP-Flow anchor to maintain the flow seamlessly during the offloading and balancing IP-Flow. Within WiFi networks, we leverage the Light Virtual Access Point (LVAP)
                  approach to abstract the WiFi protocol stack for a programming
                  capability of centralized control of WiFi network through the WiFi controller. By creating a client virtual port and assigning a specific Service Set Identifier (SSID), we give a capability to slice an operator’s network to control over his clients within a WiFi coverage area network.},

However, this model has always been viewed with some suspicion as it raises a wide range of security and privacy issues that need to be negotiated. This research focuses on the construction of a trust layer in cloud computing to build a trust relationship between cloud service providers and cloud users. In particular, we address the rise of container-based virtualisation has a weak isolation compared to traditional VMs because of the shared use of the OS kernel and system components. Therefore, we will build a trust layer to solve the issues of weaker isolation whilst maintaining the performance and scalability of the approach. This paper has two objectives. Firstly, we propose a security system to protect containers from other guests through the addition of a Role-based Access Control (RBAC) model and the provision of strict data protection and security. Secondly, we provide a stress test using isolation benchmarking tools to evaluate the isolation in containers in term of performance.},

Consequently, we ask: 'How do we eliminate the overhead of virtualisation whilst still retaining its benefits?' Motivated by this question, we investigate a practical approach for a bare-metal live migration scheme for ARM-based instances low-power servers and edge devices. In this paper, we position ARM-based bare-metal live migration as a technique that will underpin the efficiency on edge-computing and on Micro-datacentres.

This paper investigates the problem of cache node placement and selection with the coexistence of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) cache and device- to-device (D2D) cache in mobile networks. In recent years, caching popular content in UAV base stations has received growing interests as a promising solution to improve communication performances. With the agility and mobility features, the dynamic movement of cache-enabled UAV should be further designed to increase the cache-aided throughput. Different from the conventional caching approaches assuming ground users remain static, we consider the dynamic movement design of UAV to maximize the cache- aided throughput taking into account the movement of ground users. As the formulated optimization problem is NP-hard, we propose a mobility-aware probabilistic caching algorithm in which K-means clustering is utilized to obtain the partition of ground users. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm notably outperforms the pure D2D cache scheme (without UAV caching) in different cases.},

By storing popular content at the nearby mobile user devices, D2D caching is an efficient method to improve network throughput and alleviate backhaul burden. With the attractive features of high mobility and flexible deployment, UAVs have recently attracted significant attention as cache-enabled flying base stations. The use of cache-enabled UAVs opens up the possibility of tracking the mobility pattern of the corresponding users and serving them under limited cache storage capacity. However, it is challenging to determine the optimal UAV trajectory due to the dynamic environment with frequently changing network topology and the coexistence of aerial and terrestrial caching nodes. In response, we propose a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning based framework to determine the optimal 3D trajectory of each UAV in a distributed manner without a central coordinator. In the proposed method, multiple UAVs can cooperatively make flight decisions by sharing the gained experiences within a certain proximity to each other. Simulation results reveal that our algorithm outperforms the traditional single- and multi-agent Q-learning algorithms. This work confirms the feasibility and effectiveness of cache-enabled UAVs which serve as an important complement to terrestrial D2D caching nodes.},

  abstract     = {With the ever-growing demand for low-latency network applications, edge computing emerges as a new paradigm that provides computation and storage resources in close proximity to end-users. Many research efforts have resorted to network function virtualization, wherein network applications are provisioned as service function chains at edge clouds. However, due to the traffic dynamics and limited resource capacity at the network edge, how to efficiently embed service chains with latency optimization and resource efficiency remains as a challenging problem. As most existing research efforts largely overlook the bottlenecked resources of VNFs in the VNF scaling, we seek a more realistic approach to provisioning VNF instances across multiple edge clouds. Also, given the limited resources at the edge, it is of significant importance to improve the VNF utilization rate. Specifically, we formulate the VNF scaling problem as an integer linear programming (ILP) problem, aiming to minimize the endto-end latency for service function chains. To solve this problem, we devise a novel bottleneck-aware algorithm that manages the number and deployment of newly created instances. After that, we propose an online algorithm for traffic steering to improve the utilization rates of VNF instances and avoid congestion on hotspot links. The proposed algorithm is shown to provide good performance by trace-driven simulation in real-world topologies.},

Policies play an important role in network configuration and therefore in offering secure and high performance services especially over multi-tenant Cloud Data Center (DC) environments. At the same time, elastic resource provisioning through virtualization often disregards policy requirements, assuming that the policy implementation is handled by the underlying network infrastructure. This can result in policy violations, performance degradation and security vulnerabilities. In this paper, we define PLAN, a PoLicy-Aware and Network-aware VM management scheme to jointly consider DC communication cost reduction through Virtual Machine (VM) migration while meeting network policy requirements. We show that the problem is NP-hard and derive an efficient approximate algorithm to reduce communication cost while adhering to policy constraints. Through extensive evaluation, we show that PLAN can reduce topology-wide communication cost by 38\% over diverse aggregate traffic and configuration policies.},

It is reported that the inefficient management of network policies accounts for 78\% of DC downtime, challenged by the dynamically changing network characteristics and by the effects of dynamic Virtual Machine (VM) consolidation. While there has been significant research in policy and VM management, they have so far been treated as disjoint research problems. In this paper, we explore the simultaneous, dynamic VM and policy consolidation, and formulate the Policy-VM Consolidation (PVC) problem, which is shown to be NP-Hard. We then propose Sync, an efficient and synergistic scheme to jointly consolidate network policies and virtual machines. Extensive evaluation results and a testbed implementation of our controller show that policy and VM migration under Sync significantly reduces flow end-to-end delay by nearly 40\%, and network-wide communication cost by 50\% within few seconds, while adhering strictly to the requirements of network policies.},

  abstract          = {© 2018 Elsevier B.V. Data center operators deploy a variety of both physical and virtual network functions boxes (NFBs) to take advantages of inherent efficiency offered by physical NFBs with the agility and flexibility of virtual ones. However, such heterogeneity faces great challenges in correct, efficient and dynamic network policy implementation because, firstly, existing schemes are limited to exclusively physical or virtual NFBs and not a mix, and secondly, NFBs can co-exist at various locations in the network as a result of emerging technologies such as Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV). In this paper, we propose a Heterogeneous netwOrk pOlicy enforCement scheme (HOOC) to overcome these challenges. We first formulate and model HOOC, which is shown be to NP-Hard by reducing from the Multiple Knapsack Problem (MKP). We then propose an efficient online algorithm that can achieve optimal latency-wise NF service chaining amongst heterogenous NFBs. In addition, we also provide a greedy algorithm when operators prefer smaller run-time than optimality. Our simulation results show that HOOC is efficient and scalable whilst testbed implementation demonstrates that HOOC can be easily deployed in the data center environments.},

  abstract          = {© 2020 IEEE. Emerging edge computing has seen latency- sensitive services moving rapidly from cloud to the edge to take advantage of its close vicinity to end users, while cloud is retained for carrying out latency-insensitive and computation-intensive tasks. When more edge computing service providers come to the market, the network will become increasingly more fragmented because of their proprietary services and policies deployed in the network. This means that the Internet can become more cumbersome and riskier as there will be more tiers and potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited. To tackle this issue, we envisage a federated service chaining paradigm in which operators can share and put service functions in other participants' networks so as to improve resource utilization, collaboratively mitigate cyber threats, and enable service innovations. In this position article, building on our past experience in enabling federated cloud infrastructure and heterogeneous service chaining, we present a Federated Service Chaining architecture followed by discussions of its key components. Several key research challenges are described for the successful realization of such architecture. We hope this article can open a discussion in the research community and generate enough research interest to significantly advance this field.},

Often the data require real-time processing to support high system responsiveness which can be supported by localised Cloud and/or Fog computing paradigms. However, there are considerably large deployments of IoT such as sensor networks in remote areas where Internet connectivity is sparse, challenging the localised Cloud and/or Fog computing paradigms. With the advent of the Raspberry Pi, a credit card-sized single board computer, there is a great opportunity to construct low-cost, low-power portable cloud to support real-time data processing next to IoT deployments. In this paper, we extend our previous work on constructing Raspberry Pi Cloud to study its feasibility for real-time big data analytics under realistic application-level workload in both native and virtualised environments. We have extensively tested the performance of a single node Raspberry Pi 2 Model B with httperf and a cluster of 12 nodes with Apache Spark and HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System). Our results have demonstrated that our portable cloud is useful for supporting real-time big data analytics. On the other hand, our results have also unveiled that overhead for CPU-bound workload in virtualised environment is surprisingly high, at 67.2%. We have found that, for big data applications, the virtualisation overhead is fractional for small jobs but becomes more significant for large jobs, up to 28.6%.},

  abstract          = {© 2018 IEEE. Network Function Virtualisation (NFV) enables rapid deployment of new services in networks on an on-demand basis using general purpose servers. Multiple virtual network functions (VNFs) can be dynamically chained in an ordered sequence for the delivery of end-to-end services. Nevertheless, network latency caused by the sequential order of packet processing on every VNF can hurt the performance of latency-sensitive applications. To reduce such network latency, existing solutions only consider the maximum capacity of individual virtual network functions (VNFs) and do not take into account the fact that performance of VNFs, as with any software applications, is bottlenecked by either CPU or I/O peripheral capacity of the server they run on and their underneath implementation such as singleor multi-threaded.By exploiting this knowledge, we can better determine the number of required VNF instances and distribute the network traffic among them for any given VNF chain. In this paper, we formulate the VNF Scaling and Traffic Distribution problem and prove that it is NP-hard. We then present the design and implementation of Natif, an efficient VNF-Aware VNF insTantIation and traFfic distribution scheme. Through our OpenStack-based testbed evaluations, we demonstrate that Natif can significantly improve the network latency by 188\% on average as compared to other approaches. As a chain composition scheme, Natif can effectively work with any VNF chaining algorithms.},

  abstract          = {<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>Recently, the direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS)‐based technique has been proposed to trace anonymous network flows. In this technique, homogeneous pseudo‐noise (PN) codes are used to modulate multiple bit signals that are embedded into the target flow as watermarks. This technique could be maliciously used to degrade an anonymous communication network. In this paper, we propose an effective single flow‐based scheme to detect the existence of these watermarks. Our investigation shows that, even if we have no knowledge of the applied PN code, we are still able to detect malicious DSSS watermarks via mean‐square autocorrelation (MSAC) of a single modulated flow's traffic rate time series. MSAC shows periodic peaks because of self‐similarity in the modulated traffic caused by homogeneous PN codes that are used in modulating multiple bit signals. Our scheme has low complexity and does not require any PN code synchronization. We evaluate this detection scheme's effectiveness via simulations. Our results demonstrate a high detection rate with a low false positive rate. Real‐world experiments on Tor also validate the feasibility of the detection scheme. Our scheme is more flexible and accurate than the existing multiflow‐based approach in DSSS watermark detection. We also present a theory for reconstructing the DSSS code once the DSSS code length is known and simulations validate the feasibility. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley \&amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>},

  abstract          = {© 2018 Current commodity Single Board Computers (SBCs) are sufficiently powerful to run mainstream operating systems and workloads. Many of these boards may be linked together, to create small, low-cost clusters that replicate some features of large data center clusters. The Raspberry Pi Foundation produces a series of SBCs with a price/performance ratio that makes SBC clusters viable, perhaps even expendable. These clusters are an enabler for Edge/Fog Compute, where processing is pushed out towards data sources, reducing bandwidth requirements and decentralizing the architecture. In this paper we investigate use cases driving the growth of SBC clusters, we examine the trends in future hardware developments, and discuss the potential of SBC clusters as a disruptive technology. Compared to traditional clusters, SBC clusters have a reduced footprint, are low-cost, and have low power requirements. This enables different models of deployment—particularly outside traditional data center environments. We discuss the applicability of existing software and management infrastructure to support exotic deployment scenarios and anticipate the next generation of SBC. We conclude that the SBC cluster is a new and distinct computational deployment paradigm, which is applicable to a wider range of scenarios than current clusters. It facilitates Internet of Things and Smart City systems and is potentially a game changer in pushing application logic out towards the network edge.},

As low power CPUs, exemplified by ARM-based devices, are becoming increasingly popular, there is a growing trend for the large scale deployment of low power servers in data centres. For example, recent research has shown promising results on constructing small scale data centres using Raspberry Pi (RPi) single-board computers as their building blocks. To enable larger scale experimentation and feasibility studies, cloud simulators could be utilised. Unfortunately, stateof-the-art simulators often need significant modification to include such low power devices as core data centre components. In this paper, we introduce models and extensions to estimate the behaviour of these new components in the DISSECT-CF cloud computing simulator. We show that how a RPi based
                  cloud could be simulated with the use of the new models. We evaluate the precision and behaviour of the implemented models using a Hadoop-based application scenario executed both in real life and simulated clouds.},

The aim of this paper is to present findings for several classes of learning algorithm for medically related problems. The initial case study addressed in this paper involves classifying the dosage of medication required for the treatment of patients with Sickle Cell Disease. We use different machine learning architectures in order to investigate the accuracy and performance within the case study. The main purpose of applying classification approach is to enable healthcare organisations to provide accurate amount of medication. The results obtained from a range of models during our experiments have shown that of the proposed models, recurrent networks produced inferior results in comparison to conventional feedforward neural networks and the Random Forest model. For our dataset, it was found that the Random Forest Classifier produced the highest levels of performance overall.},

This paper explores an alternative paradigm where these devices are elevated, becoming members of Data Hungry Homes, allowing us to build relationships with them using the principles that we apply to family, pets or houseplants. These devices are developed to fit into a new concept of the home, can symbiotically interact with us and possess needs and traits that yield unexpected positive or negative outcomes from interacting with them. Such relationships could enrich our lives through our endeavours to “feed” our Data Hungry Homes, possibly leading us to explore new avenues and interactions outside and inside the home.},

               network dynamics and provide low-latency services, being able to migrate SFCs when needed is of paramount importance. However,
               migration of SFCs among edge and core networks such that average latency is optimized as well as considering resource consumption
               is an intractable challenge because improper migration of Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) results in failure of meeting the

               (PHS) and Average Utilization Based (AUB), are proposed to efficiently optimize average latency of all SFCs in edge-core networks.

               up to 36.9\% by allowing a marginally higher number of VNF migrations.},

This is of great interest to network operators since poor service quality and resource wastage can potentially hurt their revenue in the long term. However, the study shows with a set of test-bed experiments that packet loss at certain positions (i.e., different VNFs) in an SFC can cause various degrees of resource wastage and performance degradation because of repeated upstream processing and transmission of retransmitted packets.
               To overcome this challenge, this study focuses on resource scheduling and deployment of SFCs while considering packet loss positions. This study developed a novel SFC packet dropping cost model and formulated an SFC scheduling problem that aims to minimize overall packet dropping cost as a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) and proved that it is NP-hard. In this study, Palosis proposed as an efficient scheme in exploiting the functional characteristics of VNFs and their positions in SFCs for scheduling resources and deployment to optimize packet dropping cost. Extensive experiment results show that Palos can achieve up to 42.73\% improvement on packet dropping cost and up to 33.03\% reduction on average SFC latency when compared with two other state-of-the-art schemes.},

  abstract  = {In recent decades, many TCP Congestion Control (CC) protocols have been proposed to improve the performance and reliability of TCP in various network scenarios. However, CC protocols are usually closely coupled with network conditions such as latency and packet loss. Considering that networks with different properties are common, e.g., wired/wireless LAN and Long Fat Networks (LFNs), investigating both performance and behaviors of CC protocols under varied network scenarios becomes crucial for both network management and development. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive measurement study on the goodput, RTT, retransmission, friendliness, fairness, convergence time and stability of most widely-used CC protocols over wired LAN/WAN and wireless LAN (both 2.4GHz and 5GHz Wi-Fi). We also conduct comparative studies with respect to transmission cost, congested reverse path and bottleneck queue size in network simulator. Based on our analysis, we reveal several interesting and original observations. We found that the goodput of BBR is at least 22.5\% lower than other CC protocols in wireless LAN due to insufficient pacing rate, even though it can always fully utilize the bottleneck bandwidth with low RTT in wired networks. We also observed that the total on-wire data volume of BBR is higher than CUBIC (e.g., 2.37\% higher when RTT = 100ms and loss rate = 0.01\%). In addition, BBR can fully utilize the bottleneck bandwidth in most queue sizes (≥ 20packets). Surprisingly, we noticed that as the default CC protocol in most modern operating systems, CUBIC is too aggressive and unfriendly in both LAN and wireless LAN, greatly suppressing the goodput of other competing CC protocols. More specifically for CUBIC in wireless LAN, it generates 129\% more retransmissions than other CC protocols. Nevertheless, we have also seen that, in scenario with heavily-congested reverse path, CUBIC can provide full utilization on bottleneck bandwidth. Lastly, we also observed that BBR converges very quickly in all evaluated scenarios, while other CC protocols present varied results, e.g., Westwood+ and Veno converge faster in 5GHz Wi-Fi networks than 2.4GHz networks.},

                  However, existing solutions only focus on deploying them to
                  predefined locations. After that, they either remain stationary
                  or only move in predefined trajectories throughout the whole
                  deployment. In the open outdoor scenarios such as search and
                  rescue or large music events, etc., users can move and cluster
                  dynamically. As a result, network demand will change constantly
                  over time and hence will require the drones to adapt dynamically.
                  In this paper, we present a proof of concept implementation
                  of an UAV access point (AP) which can dynamically reposition
                  itself depends on the users movement on the ground. Our solution
                  is to continuously keeping track of the received signal strength
                  from the user devices for estimating the distance between users
                  devices and the drone, followed by trilateration to localise them.
                  This process is challenging because our on-site measurements
                  show that the heterogeneity of user devices means that change
                  of their signal strengths reacts very differently to the change of
                  distance to the drone AP. Our initial results demonstrate that
                  our drone is able to effectively localise users and autonomously
                  moving to a position closer to them.},

  abstract  = {Silent packet drops are common in data center networks, and are a major cause of network performance anomalies (NPAs) that have significant impacts on application performance and network management. However, existing solutions using coarse-grained statistics and flow-level telemetry either fail to provide precise location of packet drops or incur large overhead. This paper presents dDrops, a packet-level telemetry based on programmable data plane to detect and retrieve details of silent packet drops immediately when they happen. dDrops can dynamically adapt to varying ratios of silent packet drops for different ports on a switch to improve performance of silent packet drops detection. Moreover, a dynamic memory management scheme is also designed to efficiently use the limited memory on the data plane of switch. dDrops has been implemented on both P4 hardware programmable switches (based on Intel Tofino ASIC) and BMv2. Extensive experiment results show that dDrops is able to detect and locate the silent packet drops within 5 ms (including detailed information of dropped packets), and reduce the memory consumption by up to 50\%.},

  abstract   = {Data Center (DC) networks exhibit much more centralized characteristics than the legacy Internet, yet they are operated by similar distributed routing and control algorithms that fail to exploit topological redundancy to deliver better and more sustainable performance. Multipath protocols, for example, use node-local and heuristic information to only exploit path diversity between shortest paths. In this paper, we use a measurement-based approach to schedule flows over both shortest and non-shortest paths based on temporal network-wide utilization. We present the Baatdaat flow scheduling algorithm which uses spare DC network capacity to mitigate the performance degradation of heavily utilized links. Results show that Baatdaat achieves close to optimal Traffic Engineering by reducing network-wide maximum link utilization by up to 18\% over Equal-Cost Multi-Path (ECMP) routing, while at the same time improving flow completion time by 41\% - 95\%.},

  abstract   = {Virtual Machine (VM) management is a powerful mechanism for providing elastic services over Cloud Data Centers (DC)s. At the same time, the resulting network congestion has been repeatedly reported as the main bottleneck in DCs, even when the overall resource utilization of the infrastructure remains low. However, most current VM management strategies are traffic-agnostic, while the few that are traffic-aware only concern a static initial allocation, ignore bandwidth oversubscription, or do not scale. In this paper we present S-CORE, a scalable VM migration algorithm to dynamically reallocate VMs to servers while minimizing the overall communication footprint of active traffic flows. We formulate the aggregate VM communication as an optimization problem and we then define a novel distributed migration scheme that iteratively adapts to dynamic traffic changes. Through extensive simulation and implementation results, we show that S-CORE achieves significant (up to 87\%) communication cost reduction while incurring minimal overhead and downtime.},

  abstract          = {The advent of virtualisation and the increasing demand for outsourced, elastic compute charged on a pay-as-you-use basis has stimulated the development of large-scale Cloud Data Centres (DCs) housing tens of thousands of computer clusters. Of the significant capital outlay required for building and operating such infrastructures, server and network equipment account for 45 and 15\% of the total cost, respectively, making resource utilisation efficiency paramount in order to increase the operators’ Return-on-Investment (RoI). In this paper, we present an extensive survey on the management of server and network resources over virtualised Cloud DC infrastructures, highlighting key concepts and results, and critically discussing their limitations and implications for future research opportunities. We highlight the need for and benefits of adaptive resource provisioning that alleviates reliance on static utilisation prediction models and exploits direct measurement of resource utilisation on servers and network nodes. Coupling such distributed measurement with logically centralised Software Defined Networking (SDN) principles, we subsequently discuss the challenges and opportunities for converged resource management over converged ICT environments, through unifying control loops to globally orchestrate adaptive and load-sensitive resource provisioning.},

Virtualization is the underpinning technology enabling cloud computing service provisioning, and container-based virtualization provides an efficient sharing of the underlying host kernel libraries amongst multiple guests. While there has been research on protecting the host against compromise by malicious guests, research on protecting the guests against a compromised host is limited. In this paper, we present an access control solution which prevents the host from gaining access into the guest containers and their data. Using system call interception together with the built-in AppArmor mandatory access control (MAC) approach the solution protects guest containers from a malicious host attempting to compromise the integrity of data stored therein. Evaluation of results have shown that it can effectively prevent hostile access from host to guest containers while ensuring minimal performance overhead.},

  abstract  = {As a novel UDP-based transport protocol which supports stream multiplexing, QUIC is faster, more lightweight and flexible than TCP. With the prevalence of multi-homed devices such as smartphones with both WiFi and 4G/5G cellular connectivity, Multipath QUIC (MPQUIC) can effectively utilize multiple network interfaces (i.e., multiple paths) to improve transmission efficiency. Current MPQUIC implementation adopts the Lowest-RTT-First (LRF) scheduler which always selects the path with the lowest smoothed RTT among all available paths. However, we show that in networks with heterogeneous paths where network characteristics (e.g., RTT, loss rate) differ considerably, such scheduling scheme leads to unnecessary waiting on fast paths and bufferbloat, degrading overall transmission performance significantly. To use heterogeneous paths efficiently (i.e., to reduce the overall file transfer completion time), this paper proposes a novel scheduling mechanism that assigns data to paths with transfer simulation without causing much additional overhead. Extensive experiment results in Mininet demonstrate that the proposed scheduling mechanism can reduce the transfer completion time by up to 29.6\% as compared to existing MPQUIC implementation.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, many web services (e.g., cloud storage) are deployed inside datacenters and may trigger transfers to clients through WAN. TCP congestion control is a vital component for improving the performance (e.g., latency) of these services. Considering complex networking environment, the default congestion control algorithms on servers may not always be the most efficient, and new advanced algorithms will be proposed. However, adjusting congestion control algorithm usually requires modification of TCP stacks of servers, which is difficult if not impossible, especially considering different operating systems and configurations on servers. In this paper, we propose TCon, a light-weight, flexible and scalable platform that allows administrators (or operators) to deploy any appropriate congestion control algorithms transparently without making any changes to TCP stacks of servers. We have implemented TCon in Open vSwitch (OVS) and conducted extensive test-bed experiments by transparently deploying BBR congestion control algorithm over TCon. Test-bed results show that the BBR over TCon works effectively and the performance stays close to its native implementation on servers, reducing latency by 12.76\% on average.},

  abstract          = {© 2017 IEEE. The centralization of control plane in Software defined networking (SDN) creates a paramount challenge on troubleshooting the network as packets are ultimately forwarded by distributed data planes. Existing path tracing tools largely utilize packet tags to probe network paths among SDN-enabled switches. However, network functions (NFs) or middleboxes, whose presence is ubiquitous in today's networks, can drop packets or alter their tags - an action that can collapse the probing mechanism. In addition, sending probing packets through network functions could corrupt their internal states, risking of the correctness of servicing logic (e.g., incorrect load balancing decisions). In this paper, we present a novel troubleshooting tool, Track, for SDN-enabled network with arbitrary NFs. Track can discover the forwarding path including NFs taken by any packets, without changing the forwarding rules in switches and internal states of NFs. We have implemented Track on RYU controller. Our extensive experiment results show that Track can achieve 95.08\% and 100\% accuracy for discovering forwarding paths with and without NFs respectively, and can efficiently generate traces within 3 milliseconds per hop.},

Since only the first fragment will keep complete layer-4 (L4) header during fragmentation, a firewall that is configured to let this packet through may drop all subsequent fragments due to missing L4 headers, causing policy violations. Also, the incomplete payload in fragments could reduce processing accuracy of NFs (e.g., intrusion detection system) To address these challenges, we present FragGuide, a transparent framework to assist NFs handling fragments correctly efficiently without requiring any modification to NFs. Our experiment results show that FragGuide can achieve 100\% accuracy and zero invalid fragments for processing fragments in firewalls, and improve detection rate of IDS by 15.63\% on average, while guaranteeing lower processing latency.},

  abstract          = {© 2018 IEEE. As a vital component of TCP, congestion control defines TCP's performance characteristics. Hence, it is important for congestion control to provide high link utilization and low queuing delay. Recent BBR tries to estimate available bottleneck capacity to achieve this goal. However, its aggressiveness characteristics generate a massive amount of packet retransmission which harms loss-based congestion control protocol such as Cubic. In this paper, we first dive into this issue and reveal that the aggressiveness of BBR can degrade the performance of Cubic, as well as the overall Internet transmission. Then we present Modest BBR, a simple yet effective solution based on BBR, by responding to retransmission less aggressively. Through extensive testbed experiments and Mininet simulation, we show Modest BBR can preserve high throughput and short convergence time while improve the overall performance when coexisting with Cubic. For example, Modest BBR gets similar throughput compared to BBR, while it improves 7.1\% of the overall throughput and achieves better fairness to loss-based schemes.},

  abstract          = {© 2020 Elsevier B.V. Software Defined Networking (SDN), which decouples control plane and data plane, normally stores states on controllers to provide flexible programmability and convenient management. However, recent studies have shown that such configuration may cause frequent and unnecessary interactions between data plane and controllers in some cases. For example, a DDoS detection installed on a controller needs to fetch information from data plane periodically, introducing additional network delay and controller overhead. Thus, stateful data plane is proposed to offload states and operation logics from controller to data plane. Stateful data plane allows switches to perform some operations independently, accelerating packets processing while reducing overhead on both controllers and networks. However, stateful data plane increases the complexity of network devices and imposes many new challenges to the management and schedule of SDN enabled networks. This paper conducts a comprehensive survey on the latest research works and provides insights into stateful data plane. Both stateful data plane platforms and compilers are extensively summarized and analyzed, as well as explicit design of applications based on them. Afterwards, we dwell on the fundamental technologies and research challenges, including implementation considerations of stateful data plane. Finally, we conclude this survey paper with some future works and discuss open research issues.},

  abstract  = {Since heavy flows account for a significant fraction
               of network traffic, being able to predict heavy flows has benefited
               many network management applications for mitigating link
               congestion, scheduling of network capacity, exposing network
               attacks and so on. Existing machine learning based predictors
               are largely implemented on the control plane of Software Defined
               Networking (SDN) paradigm. As a result, frequent communication between the control and data planes can cause unnecessary
               overhead and additional delay in decision making.
               In this paper, we present pHeavy, a machine learning based
               scheme for predicting heavy flows directly on the programmable
               data plane, thus eliminating network overhead and latency to
               SDN controller. Considering the scarce memory and limited
               computation capability in the programmable data plane, pHeavy
               includes a packet processing pipeline which deploys pre-trained
               decision tree models for in-network prediction. We have implemented pHeavy in both bmv2 software switch and P4 hardware
               switch (i.e., Barefoot Tofino).Evaluation results demonstrate that
               pHeavy has achieved 85\% and 98\% accuracy after receiving the
               first 5 and 20 packets of a flow respectively, while being able
               to reduce the size of decision tree by 5.4x on average. More
               importantly, pHeavy can predict heavy flows at line rate on the
               P4 hardware switch.},

  abstract     = {Dynamic service function chains (SFC) are enabled by network function virtualization on general purpose servers. The emergence of programmable data planes (PDP) has offered a new way for the deployment of SFC. However, the implementation of network functions is constrained by resource limitations in PDPs (e.g., compute and memory resource). Moreover, most of existing works do not consider the optimization of state information (e.g., registers), which is essential for stateful network functions. In this paper, we propose pSFC which provides a fine-grained SFC deployment scheme in the PDP to tackle the problem. We first model network functions as control flow graphs (CFG) and the process of deployment as a one big switch (OBS) problem, and then propose an ILP (Integer Linear Programming) model for resource optimization for the OBS problem, which is NP-hard. To solve this problem efficiently, pSFC first composes multiple SFCs for eliminating redundant resources, decomposes the compound CFG based on the resource limitation per stage, and finally maps OBS into the substrate network. We have implemented pSFC in both bmv2 software switch and P4 hardware switch (i.e., Intel Tofino). Evaluation shows that pSFC reduces switch costs 45.7\% and average latency 15\% while providing the correctness of the process of SFC.},
